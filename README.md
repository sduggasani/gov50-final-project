# Money Talks: Investigating the Relationship between Campaign Spending and Vote Share in U.S. House Elections

**Author:** Sammy Duggasani

This repository contains materials for a final project examining the relationship between campaign spending and vote share in U.S. House of Representatives general elections (2010–2014). Specifically, it investigates whether candidates who spend a greater share of total disbursements in a race garner a larger share of votes.



## Overview
This project aims to answer the question: **Does a higher percentage share of total spending in a U.S. House race lead to a higher share of votes for a candidate?** The analysis explores the following:
1. Visualization of the relationship between spending share and vote share.
2. An examination of how incumbency status (Incumbent, Challenger, Open Seat) affects this relationship.
3. A multiple linear regression model testing the effect of spending share on vote share, controlling for incumbency.

The results indicate a moderate and positive relationship between a candidate’s share of total disbursements and their general election vote share.
